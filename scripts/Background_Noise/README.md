# LLAD-MPEG-7-MATLAB-PORT
## Background Noise

A JS port of the Matlab Background Noise LLAD (Low Level Audio Descrptor)

The orginal .m file processes an audio file over it's entire length and gives an average of the background noise level. This functionality is omitted as it is intended to read indivual buffers defined in the global scope.
